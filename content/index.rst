Quantum Autumn School 2023
==========================

Recent developments in quantum technology are bringing the world closer to a new technological revolution – the advent of usable quantum computers able to provide enormous acceleration to important computational tasks. In coming years, quantum computing is expected to have a significant impact on many areas of research that can utilise computational modelling. 
Indeed, significant efforts and investments are currently underway in Europe to `bolster skills and capacity within quantum computing <https://enccs.se/news/2023/06/european-hpc-quantum-computing-infrastructure/>`__.

ENCCS is again joining forces with the `Wallenberg Centre of Quantum Technologies (WACQT) <https://www.chalmers.se/en/centres/wacqt/>`__ and the `Nordic/Baltic NordIQuEst <https://nordiquest.net/>`__ project to deliver a three-day autumn school covering the fundamentals of quantum computing. The school will also be visited by and contributed to by `Algorithmiq <https://algorithmiq.fi/>`__, a Finnish startup which aims to revolutionise life sciences by exploiting the potential of quantum computing to solve currently inaccessible problems.

WACQT is a national research programme, coordinated from Chalmers, that aims to take Swedish research and industry to the forefront of quantum technology. The main project of WACQT is to develop a high-end quantum computer that can solve problems far beyond the reach of the best conventional supercomputers.

NordΙQuEst brings together a consortium of seven partners from five Nordic and Baltic countries to connect world leading traditional HPC resources and quantum computers across national borders with the aim to establish a quantum computing platform customised to the needs of the region.
