    "Before we begin, let us summarize the task ahead of us, and what exactly we are going to do. Remember that VQE starts with classical preparations. This involves all the classical computational chemistry computations we summarized in the lecture. As a result of these preparations we have the qubit Hamiltonian and the ansatz circuit that represents the parameterized unitary. We assume that all this work has been completed: the result is the ansatz circuit and the Hamiltonian shown in the figure above.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us summarize the computation shown in the figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm consists of two parts. Firstly, there is a computation carried out on a quantum computer. This is divided into three parts in the figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prepare initial state,\n",
    "2. Apply Parameterized Ansatz, and\n",
    "3. Measure Expectation values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire quantum computation is performed using the circuit shown at the bottom part, 'Software'. Note the circuit contains only two qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, there is the classical part, comprising \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate Energy, and\n",
    "2. Classical Optimizer Suggests New Parameters $\\theta$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The qubit Hamiltonian of $H_2$ is also shown on the right. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the top part of the figure also shows a rough outline of physical pulses with timings that are needed to run the circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will implement both the classical and quantum parts in Python using Qiskit. We will implement the algorithm from scratch *without* using the more advanced Qiskit libraries. We will only rely circuits and measurements. In principle, we will show how to implement the algorithm in *any language that contains circuits and measurements*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rationale of showing this simple, low-level implementation is to give a taste of what is going on behind the scenes of the more advanced (Qiskit) libraries."
