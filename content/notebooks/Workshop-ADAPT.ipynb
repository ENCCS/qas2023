    "## Active space methods in quantum chemistry\n",
    "\n",
    "Most quantum chemistry simulations assume that a single Slater determinant (the _reference_) gives a _qualitatively_ accurate description of the electronic structure of the system. When such as assumption is correct, going beyond a qualitative description can be achieved by adding further Slater determinants. These additional Slater determinants are built systematically by exciting simultaneously one, two, or more electrons from the occupied to the unoccupied (or virtual) molecular orbitals, _i.e._ the optimized one-electron basis functions.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/excitations.png\" style=\"width:300px;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Including all possible excitation ranks from/to all possible orbitals generates the _full configuration interaction_ (FCI) wavefunction, which is the exact ground state for the given molecular Hamiltonian in the given atomic orbital basis. Clearly, inclusion of all Slater determinants scales exponentially and is feasible only for quite small systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, it's usually not necessary to resort to FCI. This is because a better qualitative description can be obtained by correlating a _subset_ only of orbitals and electrons, leading to so-called _active space methods_.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/CAS.png\" style=\"width:500px;display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The _complete active space_ (CAS) family of methods is the most common. The user selects, usually guided by chemical intuition, relevant subsets of $N$ electrons and $M$ orbitals to correlate. In the jargon, this is a CAS($N$,$M$) calculation. The wavefunction expansion is constructed as a linear combination of all determinants which include all possible excitations within the selected subspace. Further, if the one-particle basis is optimized simultaneously with the expansion coefficients, the methods is called _complete active space self-consistent field_ (CASSCF). Otherwise, it is called _complete active space configuration interaction_ (CASCI)."

    "The previous example for $H_2$ started from an _a priori_ fixed structure of the wavefunction ansatz, leaving parameters free for optimization through the joing work of quantum and classical subroutines. While a fixed ansatz structure gives us the tools to bound the requirements on the quantum hardware, both in terms of number of qubits and circuit depth, it might suffer from lack of flexibility and make it difficult to optimize the free parameters in a reasonable number of steps.\n",
