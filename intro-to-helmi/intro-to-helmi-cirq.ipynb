    "Helmi is a 5 qubit Quantum Computer that is co-developed by [VTT](https://www.vttresearch.com/en/ourservices/quantum-technology) and [IQM](https://www.meetiqm.com/). It uses superconducting transmon qubits in a star shaped topology. Helmi's natives gates consist of the phased-rx and controlled-z gates. This architecture is called **Adonis** by IQM.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial running on Helmi is demonstrated using the Cirq framework. You can also run on Helmi using [Qiskit](https://qiskit.org/) with the [qiskit-on-iqm](https://github.com/iqm-finland/qiskit-on-iqm) adapter, and this is described in a separate notebook.  \n",
